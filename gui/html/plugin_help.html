        <h4>Disclaimer</h4>
            <p>
                Zeeguu is a personal research project. Several people have
                voluntarily contributed to bring it to the point where it is
                good enough for you to use and benefit from it.
                However, nobody works on it full-time, and thus, if you
                find problems with it please let us know. We are thankful for feedback.
                Moreover, the project is open-source, so if you want to contribute contact
                us!
            </p>

        <h4>Is this you?</h4>
            <p>
                You are learning a new language and you are
                making good progress. You achieved a good level
                already, you know the basics of grammar,
                and even dare to talk to your old neighbour about
                the weather. However, approaching news articles, blogs,
                emails, or the facebook wall of your friends who speak
                that language is still far from being fun.

                The main reason is that too often
                you still encounter a word that you don't
                understand. You wish that
                you could accelerate the rate at which you acquire the
                vocabulary of this new language.
            </p>
            <p>
                You tried flash cards but they bore you. You tried
                DuoLingo but you gave up. The first has the disadvantage
                of being boring... words are out of context, and it bores
                you to death. You don't do it anymore, not even when you
                are on the toiet and forgot to bring a good book.
                The second forces you to read texts which
                are not interesting. You don't care about their
                content.
            </p>

            <p>
                However, you know that you remember something
                better if you are emotionally involved, and you
                can get yourself to read in the new language if you
                are curious about the text. Thus, it would be cool if you could
                study vocabulary in the context of texts that are
                interesting to you: the facebook wall of your friends,
                a newspaper in the language you are learning, or
                maybe an interesting blog.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you discovered yourself at least partially
                in the previous lines, then this project could be useful for you.
            </p>

        <h4>Environmental Learning</h4>
        <p>
            Once you have passed a certain knowledge threshold in a foreign
            language, you are ready for what is called environmental
            learning. This is, learning things in their natural context.
        </p>
        <p>
            A famous open source hacker, Richard Stallman, told the
            story once of the way he learns a new language. Once he
            has learned the basic hundred words, and a bit of grammar,
            he immerses himself in reading children's books.
            After that, he moves on to reading other things that
            interest him.
        </p>

        <p>
            The goal of Zeeguu, is to support you in accelerating
            your vocabulary acquisition
        </p>

        <p>
            The plugin provides you with translations for
        the words that you are looking up. It also automatically
            uploads to your online profile the word, translation,
            and context if you save them. In this way, you can
            get later personalized exercises and better translations.
        </p>

            <p>
                <b>Note:</b> The next section assumes that you
                know what a zeeguu profile is, and that you have created
                an account on the Zeeguu website, installed the
                plugin locally, and declared a langauge that you
                are learning.
            </p>

        <h4>Your Vocabulary Profile</h4>
            <p>
                At the center of all the apps in the Zeeguu
                ecosystem lays your <em>vocabulary profile</em>.
                That is, an active way of tracking and estimating
                your current knowledge of the vocabulary of the
                target language.
            </p>

            <p>
                The profile contains all the words that you have
                ever looked via this plugin or other apps in the
                ecosystem. If for a given word you didn't like the
                default translation, and uploaded a separate word
                that is also stored.
            </p>
            <p>
                One final aspect that is stored in your profile
            is the context in which you looked up the words. In the
            case of words that are looked up in web pages, the
            context is the sentence in which the word was looked up,
                together with the address of the page in which the word was found.
            </p>


        <h4>Why is the profile important?</h4>
            <p>
                The more precise the estimation of your current
                knowledge of the vocabulary of the desired language is
                available, of the words you learn, and the words that
                you still don't know, and the context in which you
                have already encountered those words in the past,
                the easier is to achieved several awesome things.
            </p>

            <p>
                Let us take several examples:
            </p>

            <p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        If the relative importance of the words that you
                        are learning, would be known, then rehearsal could
                        prioritize those most important. Especially when you
                        don't have too much time.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        As you are rehearsing the words that you are learning
                        you could use the context in which you originally
                        found them to make them fixate better.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If the times when a word has been seen in the past
                        are known, then the times when these words should
                        be repeated can be targeted based on the well-known
                        principle of spaced repetition.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        You could get recommendations of texts that are
                        likely to be interesting for you and are of the
                        appropriate difficulty.
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </p>

        <p>
            Some of this work is already done, and some is still future work.
            However, as you can probably imagine, a critical part of the system
            is intercepting the words that you need translations for, and their
            contexts.
        </p>



        <h4>Translating Words in Pages</h4>
        <p>
            When you hold <b>Alt pressed</b> and <b>select a word</b>
            a popup appears with the corresponding
            translation as you can see in the figure below where the
            user has selected the German word Über (which in English
            means About).
        </p>

        <p class="centeredImage">
        <img width="360px" src="../img/popup-menu.png"/><br/>
        </p>

        <p>
            <b>ProTip:</b> The fastest way to select a word is to double-click it.
        </p>

        <p>
            If you are happy with the translation, and want to save
            the word to your online profile, click on the <b>save</b> link.
            The popup disappears, and the word together with the translation
            are uploaded to your online profile.
        </p>




        <h4>External Dictionaries</h4>
        <p>
            Sometimes no good translation can be automatically suggested.
            Sometimes the suggested translation does not feel good enough.
            And sometimes you would like to know alternate translations of
            the word.
        </p>
        <p>
            In these cases, if an external dictionary exists for the pair of
            languages that you are learning, and you are already speaking,
            the plugin can display it. You click on the <b>More</b>
            link and the external dictionary is displayed as in the example
            bellow:
        </p>

        <p class="centeredImage">
            <img width="360px" src="../img/dictionary-frame-ann.png"/><br/>
        </p>

        <p>
            Not all dictionaries can be embedded in the mini-window. If you have
            a favorite one, and would like it added, please send us an email with
            the link to it.
        </p>



        <h4>Being a good citizen: contributing translations</h4>
            <p>
                Since the original translation was not good enough, but
                you found a good translation in the external dictionary,
                you can upload the translation to the system. This is good
                for you since next time you  will encounter the word, your
                translation will be available witout requiring the external
                dictionary anymore. And it is good for others, since in
                some cases your translations would be made available also
                for other users.
            </p>


            <p>
                To contribute a translation, when the external dictionary
                is displayed, you can type it in the Translation field it
                gets automatically uploaded to your profile when you close
                the external dictionary mini-window.
            </p>

            <p>
                If no external dictionary is available, it would still be awesome
                if you could look it up in a third-party dictionary and contribute
                a translation. Remember, that translating the word means that you
                won't have to look it up again. And the translation will be available
                also on all your devices.
            </p>
            <p>
                Since this translation might be in some cases displayed for other
                users, it's important that you always work with the two languages
                that you have declared in your settings.
            </p>


        <p>
                <b>ProTip</b>: you don't actually have to type the translation; it is
                sufficient that you select the corresponding word in the dictionary
                window and the translation box will be filled automatically. You either
                    use the
            </p>


        <h4>Your Words Highlighted</h4>
        <p>
            The words that you have looked up in the past are highlighted
            in every page that you visit as exemplified in the picture
            below. We are working on having different colors for words
            that you have already learned and words that you don't know
            very well yet.
        </p>
            <p class="centeredImage">
                <img width="440px" src="../img/highlighting-words.png"/><br/>
            </p>



        <h4>The Mini-Window</h4>

            <p>
                The second way in which you can interact with the
                Zeeguu plugin is via its mini-window accessible when you
                click the Zeeguu icon in the browser toolbar.

                The figure bellow shows the mini-window which provides
                you with two things.

                <ol>
                    <li>A "translate" edit box for quickly looking up definitions.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        A toolbar with six  action buttons described in the figure.
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </p>

            <p class="centeredImage">
                <img width="360px" src="../img/mini-window-icons.png"/>
            </p>

        <h4>Work Before Play (Experimental Feature)</h4>
        <p>

            Imagine that one day you realize that you go too often to
            a given website: be it Facebook, Twitter, or Inbox. Your
            education has also taught you that
                        fun should come only after work so you enable
            the Work Before Play feature of the Zeeguu in Chrome.
        </p>

        <p>
            Now, Zeeguu will intercept your navigation to any of the
            afore-mentioned sites and always give you a vocabulary exercise before
            allowing you to open the site in a new tab. This way you will
            be forced to do a bit of extra work before your leisurely
            socializing online.
        </p>

        <p>
            The list of websites who are intercepted by the Work Before Play
            feature can be set in the plugin preferences.
        </p>


        <h3>Data Privacy</h3>

        <p>
            When you save a translation, the word, translation, and context
            are uploaded to the server. Note that by context we mean the
            surrounding sentence.
        </p>
        <p>
            The context can not always be extracted, so there is no guarantee
            that it will always be uploaded.
        </p>
        <p>
            When you lookup a translation, the date of the lookup is also
            sent to the server. Maybe in the future the context will also
            be sent.
        </p>
        <p>
            The communication between all the zeeguu apps and the zeeguu server
            is always encrypted. We try to keep the server secure, but
            no security is perfect, and it could be that one day somebody
            will eventually break into our sever and steal all your words and translations.
            This is why we advise you not to upload any secret translations,
            or contexts that are sensitive.
        </p>
